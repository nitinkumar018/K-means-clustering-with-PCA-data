# K-means-clustering-with-PCA-data
## Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
## Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
## Determine the optimal number of principal components using technique like cumulative explained variance
## Transform the original dataset into the principal components

# Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) to the original dataset. Apply the same clustering algorithm to the PCA-transformed dataset
## Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score 
## Compare the clustering results obtained from the original dataset and PCA-transformed data
